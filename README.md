# functional-core-async

A *tiny*, *simple*, *functional* implementation of the meat of core.async.

## Why

[core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) is a great tool.

It makes writing concurrent software much simpler by getting data out
of callbacks through the use of magic portals called `channels`.

The problem is that it is implemented using unwieldy macros, posing problems such as
inability to work across fn-boundaries, leading to subtle bugs.

This is a minimal implementation using an event loop and functions.

## Differences from `core.async`
- `>!` and `<!` are implemented as functions and play nicely with the rest of Clojure
- `>!!` and `<!!` don't exist - the single bang versions work outside `go` blocks too
- `go` blocks (lightweight 'threads') are multiplexed over a single JVM thread

## Usage

Let's look at an everyday async call to the database to fetch a string
corresponding to the given id -

### Simple Callback
```clojure
;; from examples.clj
(defn async-callback []
  (get-user-from-db :user0
                    #(let [massaged-resp (seq %)]
                       (println "via cb:" massaged-resp)
                       (println "but can't access outside callback :("))))
```

The function fires a query to the db and immediately returns `nil`.

In this implementation, the response is locked inside the callback
and whatever code needs access to it should be put inside that callback.

This leads to what is called [callback-hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
which can be escaped with the help of those handy magic portals we talked about.

### Channels to The Rescue
```clojure
;; from examples.clj
(defn async-ch []
  (let [ch (chan)]
    (get-user-from-db :user1
                      #(>! ch %))
    (println "but blocks on accessing response :(")
    (let [resp (<! ch)
          massaged-resp (seq resp)]
      (println "via ch:" massaged-resp)
      massaged-resp)))
```

In this version, we have modified the callback to just put the response onto
the channel `ch`. The db call is made asynchronously and the call to print
is executed immediately afterwards.

When we get our response from the channel, however, the thread blocks, waiting
for the callback to complete and `ch` to receive a value.

We then take the return value from `ch` and voila! We have the response out of
the callback! It's unfortunate that our function has now become blocking, though.

### Fully Async
```clojure
;; from examples.clj
(defn async-ch+go []
  (let [ch (chan)]
    (get-user-from-db :user2
                      #(>! ch %))
    (go
      (let [resp (<! ch)
            massaged-resp (seq resp)]
        (println "via go ch:" massaged-resp)
        (println "and didn't block!")
        massaged-resp))))
```

This version is only slightly different to the previous one.
We put the fn body after the async call to the database inside
a `go` block, which is executed on the `async-executor` thread,
immediately returning a channel.

We can then call `(<! c)` on that channel to get `massaged-resp`.
So now we have sequential code instead of nested hell while
being fully async!

## NOTE

Because `go` blocks are multiplexed onto a single real thread,
calling blocking calls inside them is not a good idea as they may
block other `go`s.

To make concurrent blocking calls, such as network calls or heavy
computations, use `thread` blocks that run their bodies inside
Clojure `future`s (JVM threads).

```clojure
(def ch
  (thread (blocking-call)))
```

## TODO

* preserve thread-local bindings in `go` blocks
* implement `alts!`
* unify `go` and `thread` (smart scheduling)
